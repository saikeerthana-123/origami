    <h3>There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels.
        Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes.
        Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat.</h1>

    <h3>THEIR FEET WORK LIKE SALAD TONGS.
        ALMOST HALF OF ALL KNOWN SPECIES LIVE IN MADAGASCAR.
        CHAMELEONS VARY WILDLY IN TERMS OF SIZE.
        THEY MAINLY CHANGE COLOR IN ORDER TO COMMUNICATE OR REGULATE BODY TEMPERATURE.</h1>

    <h3>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals.
         They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – 
         a test of self recognition.
          They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs
        Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities.</h1>

    <h3>The term bear-hug was first recorded in 1846.
        The Teddy Bears' Picnic song was originally called The Teddy Bear Two Step.
        The Oxford English Dictionary dates the first use of the term teddy bear to 1906.
        In 1902 in Germany, Steiff launched “Bear 55 PB”, the first toy bear with jointed arms and legs.</h1>

    <h3>Giant pandas are good at climbing trees and can also swim.
        Pandas go from pink to white and black (or brown). 
        Pandas have so many fans because they look cute. 
        Pandas are "lazy" — eating and sleeping make their day.
        An adult can eat 12–38 kilos of bamboo per day!</h1>

    <h3>Cicadas are like tiny violins
        Cicadas make noise like toy frogs
        Cicadas kind of ‘sweat’
        They’re underground builders</h1>
